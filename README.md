# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing company data to understand customer behavior, pricing trends, and competitor comparison. The goal of the analysis is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that can support better business decisions.

Using tools like Python, Excel, and Power BI, the data was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized through an interactive dashboard.

## 🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer demographics such as age and gender

Compare company prices with competitor prices

Categorize customers into meaningful age groups

Identify pricing patterns and business trends

Present insights through clear visualizations

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed duplicate and inconsistent records

Handled missing values

Standardized data formats

Created calculated columns such as:

Age Category (Young, Middle, Senior)

Competitor Price Category (Competitor Expensive / Cheaper)

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Age-wise customer distribution

Company vs competitor price comparison

Sales contribution by age group

Gender-based analysis

Bar charts and column charts were used for better clarity and easy interpretation.

## 📊 Dashboard & Visualizations

An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI that includes:

KPI cards (Total Sales, Average Price, Customer Count)

Bar and column charts for comparison

Filters by age group, gender, and price category

The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand key insights.
